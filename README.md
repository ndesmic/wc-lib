Web Component Library

A library of custom elements built in minimal vanilla js with no dependencies.

They are divided into:

- old-components - these are mostly okay but might not adhere as closely to some of my new conventions
- components - these adhere to newer conventions
- mini-apps - these are much higher level components that are small apps themselves and might need additional CSS/HTML to function.  These create use-cases for the other components as well as useful tools.

All of these are in different states of development so they might be completely unfinished experiments are even just boilerplate.
